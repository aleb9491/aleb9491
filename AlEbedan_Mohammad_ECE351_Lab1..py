#%% comment section

#%% section 1

#In the frist section, we learn how to write a function in term of time.

#%% section 2

#In the second section, we were introduced to how we square a variable in Python and
# how it is different from other languages. 

#%% section 3

#Third, we were taught how we use Variables that contain multiple values are
# called lists in Python. For many function used
#in this lab, we will prefer to use numpy arrays,
# which operate similarly to lists. 
 
#%% section 4
 
#In part four, it was about how to comment in Python. The number sign "#" is used in Python to make a line of code a comment. Thoroughly
#commenting our code is encouraged, as it demonstrates us comfortable with the purpose
#of the various functions used and makes it easier for us to debug our code, while we are testing if the other function works or not. #

#%% section 5
 
#In addition, in Python we will not be able to create a larger array unless we include Python and its packages in order to be able to make a larger array.

#%% section 6
 
# In 351 signals and systems lab, we will be using Indexing lists and arrays a lot in order to use them in some experiment. Thus, we need to learn how to use them in Python.

#%% section 7

#In addition, sometimes in somecases we need to use matrix, so in this part since we learn how to use array, we can defined array as matrix of zeros and ones. 

#%% section 8

#Therefore, since the only way to see signals is through graph, we were intreduced on how to use matlpotlib.pyplot in order to plot in python.

#%% section 9

#Moreover, as electrical Engineering we use both AC signals and impedance, and both AC signals and impedance are convenient to represent and calculate by complex number, so we learned that.
#However, we need to learn how to use them in Python.
#As result, we learn complex numbers are defined in Python as follows, with j being the imaginary number.

#%% Question

#1. Which course are you most excited for in your degree? Which course have you enjoyed the
#most so far? 

# I was very excited amd enjoyed to take ECE101, and 210 because I have leared the most important things that related to my major. 

#2. Leave any feedback on the clarity of the expectations, instructions, and deliverables.

#I thank, it's better to share or show us pictures to guide us to what we have to do in each lab.
